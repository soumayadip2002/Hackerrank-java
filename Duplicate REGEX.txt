regex = "\\b(\\w+)(?:\\W+\\1\\b)+";
The details of the above regular expression can be understood as: 
“\\b”: A word boundary. Boundaries are needed for special cases. For example, in “My thesis is great”, “is” wont be matched twice.
“\\w+” A word character: [a-zA-Z_0-9] 
 
“\\W+”: A non-word character: [^\w] 
 
“\\1”: Matches whatever was matched in the 1st group of parentheses, which in this case is the (\w+) 
 
“+”: Match whatever it’s placed after 1 or more times
